    "A collection is a data container, defined on Couchbase Server, within a bucket. Up to 1000 collections can be created per cluster. Item-names must be unique within their collection. Items can optionally be assigned to different collections according to content-type. For example, within a bucket that contains travel information, documents that relate specifically to airports might be assigned to an airports collection, while documents that relate to hotels might be assigned to a hotels collection, and so on. Applications can be assigned per-collection access-rights; allowing each application to access only those collections it requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scope is a mechanism for the grouping of multiple collections. Up to 1000 scopes can be created per cluster. Collection-names must be unique within their scope. Collections might be assigned to different scopes according to content-type, or to deployment-phase (ie, test versus production).
