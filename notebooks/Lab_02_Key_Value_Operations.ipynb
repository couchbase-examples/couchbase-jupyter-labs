    "## Key Value Operations\n",
    "While Couchbase is a document database, at its heart is a distributed key-value (KV) store.\n",
    "A KV store is an extremely simple, schema-less approach to data management that, as\n",
    "the name implies, stores a unique ID (key) together with a piece of arbitrary information\n",
    "(value); it may be thought of as a hash map or dictionary. The KV store itself can accept\n",
    "any data, whether it be a binary blob or a JSON document, and Couchbase features such\n",
    "as SQL++(formerly N1QL) make use of the KV store’s ability to process JSON documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their simplicity, KV operations execute with extremely low latency, often sub-\n",
    "millisecond. The KV store is accessed using simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\n",
    "APIs, and provide the simplest interface when accessing documents using their IDs.\n",
    "The KV store contains the authoritative, most up-to-date state for each item. Query, and\n",
    "other services, provide eventually consistent indexes, but querying the KV store directly\n",
    "will always access the latest version of data. Applications use the KV store when speed,\n",
    "consistency, and simplified access patterns are preferred over flexible query options.\n",
    "All KV operations are atomic, which means that Read and Update are individual operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid conflicts that might arise with multiple concurrent updates to the same document, applications may make use of Compare-And-Swap (CAS), which is a per document checksum that Couchbase modifies each time a document is changed. We will see more on CAS in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Value (KV) or data service offers the simplest way to retrieve or mutate data where the key is known. Here we cover CRUD operations, document expiration, and optimistic locking with CAS."

This allows highly consistent in-memory performance, without disk-based fluctuations. It also allows faster node rebalances and restarts.\n",

By caching frequently-used data, Memcached buckets reduce the number of queries a database-server must perform.
