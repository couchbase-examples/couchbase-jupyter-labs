    "Creating the right index — with the right keys, in the right order, and using the right expressions — is critical to query performance in any database system. This is true for Couchbase as well.

Generally tuning the slower and most frequently used N1QL queries will yield the highest results. Additionally, depending on your response and SLA needs you will need to identify and tune specific queries. As in many scenarios generally, the Pareto principle applies to query tuning as well - 80% of your workload/performance problems are probably caused by 20% of your queries - focus and tune that 20% of your queries\n",
    "- Verify that the execution plans produced by the query optimizer for these statements are reasonable and expected. Note: Couchbase currently is a RULE based optimizer and not a COST based optimizer so key or index cardinality do not impact the choice of the index or creation of the overall query plan\n",
    "- Implement corrective actions to generate better execution plans for poorly performing SQL statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous steps are repeated until the query performance reaches a satisfactory level or no more statements can be tuned.\n",
