    "## N1QL/SQL++\n",
    "N1QL (pronounced “nickel”) is Couchbase’s next-generation query language. N1QL aims to meet the query needs of distributed document-oriented databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The N1QL data model derives its name from the non-first normal form, which is a superset and generalization of the relational first normal form (1NF).\n",
    "\n",
    "N1QL is a JSON query language for executing industry-standard ANSI joins and querying, transforming, and manipulating JSON data – just like SQL. With native support for N1QL, Couchbase allows you to visualize and optimize complex query plans for large datasets, deliver the best performance at any scale, and meet the demands of millions of users."
